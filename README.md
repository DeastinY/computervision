# Computer Vision
This repository contains different CV algorithms in Python.  
Documentation can be found [here](http://computervision.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Setup
I recommend creating a **virtualenv** and setting up the requirements using **Python 3.6.1**  
For **OpenCV** you can follow [this tutorial](http://cyaninfinite.com/tutorials/installing-opencv-in-ubuntu-for-python-3/).  
*If you have issues with gcc 6 you can use e.g. `sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-5 1` to prefer gcc 5 for the installation.*

## What is this ?
  - `computervision.py`: Different small functions for color splits, binary conversion, edge detection, ...
  - `mean_shift`: Implementation of the mean-shift algorithm. [Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14Db6y4Svfljd8qHcTz2Z5DY7x0skYbF07nH6m83NyfM/edit?usp=sharing)
  - `visualize.py`: Generate plots for the code. Currently only visualizations for mean-shift are implemented.
  
## Collaboration
You are very welcome to contribute and help in many different ways ! These could include, but are not limited to:  
*writing documentation, adding examples, adding results, starting discussions, writing tutorials, providing feedback, ...*
